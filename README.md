The NFTs in this demo were generated using my NFT-MINTER repository https://github.com/ghayth-farhat99/NFT-MINTER , which creates NFTs based on layers such as background, eye, hair, mask, mouth, and person.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
